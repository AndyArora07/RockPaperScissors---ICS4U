This program is a user-friendly Rock Paper Scissors game featuring a Quad-window interface that segregates the game's main menu, gameplay, and help instructions into distinct areas for a clean and organized user experience.

Key GUI features include 'custom component painting' for window backgrounds to simulate the experience of playing an actual game, the background from the 'WinWindow' was created by me in Google drawings. The game also features SFX to increase the feeling of playing an actual game. The game also effectively uses images to convey the result of each round showing the user and the computer's choices.  

Key UI features include the use of responsive buttons, the game windows are navigated through the use of buttons, for example the ‘Back’ button which will return users to their previous window no matter where its called. The ‘Play’ & ‘Help” buttons also open their own respective windows. Play button, where the user spends the majority of the time playing the game, tracking their score against the computer. Help button, which has the instructions and an explanation of the program. 

For this code I decided to expand significantly on the UX, and faced many challenges such as  as sophisticated layout management and efficient resource loading, since everytime I added a feature I found two more I wanted to add, which is the main reason SFX were added. This meant I would have to keep restructuring my code, making it so I would have to keep reordering my syntax. This problem wasn’t really “managed”, I just kept doing it as I progressed. Next time I will create a firm idea of what I want, and use resources like GPT to create a framework I could use, to save time.

I also faced many syntax related issues, namely adding SFX and button styling, to help me overcome these issues I referred to some of the button layout resources on the daily agenda and watched many youtube tutorials, such as Bro Code’s & NoobCoder (from Brightspace).
